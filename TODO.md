# TO DO



- [ ]  Correct random movements (analyze if current board is different from the expected current state, and, if so, prioritize correcting it to the expected current state)

- [ ]  Reduce number of for loops, especially nested for loops (use recursion, comprehensions etc.)

- [ ]  Transition arrays to min (?) heaps to find the lowest g score faster
